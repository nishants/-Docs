# Mindset Challenges
- gamification is different from usual business app, where development is usually driven by a list of features
- gamification should be experience driven, rather than feature driven.
- prototyping is the only good way of defining and discovering ur end user exprience.

# Using Prototyping to Discover End Product
- we built the first fully functional prototype within a week of initiation
- we kept on building on top of the prototype for four weeks
- every week we demonstrated the prototype to all of team
- no user stories were ready when we began the prototyping for the first time

# Project Management Challenges
- hard to define a gamification exprience in terms of a checklist
- designer, founder, marketing, technical experts were well aligned on idea but common understanding of end product was missing
- it was hard to define requirements in terms of backlog, hence creating good user stories was impossible.
- prototyping itself is again hard to estimate, we allowed a product designer to play around with our idea and be creative.
- prototyping occupied one dedicated resource over the period of 4 weeks.

# Consulting Challenges
- technical team had recently decided to migrate to reactjs based techstack.
- the feature itself being so complex, was a terrible starting point to migration to new tech stack.
- instead advised them on not using react for a new and critical feature, but begin by re-writting what we had already built
- technical team ignored advice and moved ahead with building the feature with reactjs.
- this was mainly driven by developers anxiety (i dont know that cool new thing that earns jobs) and beleif in the fact that because their rockstar programmer  wrote nice crisp code with Rails, and promised he would do the same with react (instead of having no real project exprience with it)
