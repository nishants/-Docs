# Product Challenges
- gamification is different from usual business app, where development is usually driven by a list of features
- gamification should be experience driven, rather than feature driven.
- prototyping is the only good way of defining and discovering ur end user exprience.
- there were four months to deliver the feature 
- it was a bootstrapped startup with a team distributed across the globe.

# Using Prototyping to Discover End Product
- we built the first fully functional prototype within a week of initiation
- we kept on building on top of the prototype for four weeks
- every week we demonstrated the prototype to all of team
- no user stories were ready when we began the prototyping for the first time

# Project Management Challenges
- hard to define a gamification exprience in terms of a checklist
- designer, founder, marketing, technical experts and content writers lacked a common understanding of end product.
- it was hard to define requirements in terms of backlog, hence creating good user stories was impossible.
- developers were not confident of task lists, spikes, estimations required to plan the realease.
- prototyping itself is again hard to estimate, we allowed a product designer to play around with our idea and be free and creative  with whatever he comes up with.
- prototyping occupied one dedicated resource over the period of 4 weeks.

# Consulting Challenges
- collaboration across team was severly anaemic, ideas were impossible to flow. 
- only time team came together was a weekly 1 hour call. 
- separation of product and develivery team was very evident.
- team members had communication in public channels, and product team might often not reply to direct messages.
- cultural and geographical barriers made it even harder to get the team together.

- technical team lacked a culture of working with consultants 
- team morale was low, and on first interview with a developer, he confessed of being a "foot sodier" and felt he had no contribution in decision making
- technical team was thinking in terms of techs and framework, and there was a lack of problem solving approach.
- technical team lacked diversity, all devs were males with background of fullstack rails developer.

- technical team had recently decided to migrate to reactjs based techstack.
- instead advised them on not using react for a new and critical feature, but begin by re-writting what team had already built
- technical team ignored advice and moved ahead with building the feature with reactjs.
- this was mainly driven by developers anxiety (i dont know that cool new thing that earns jobs) and beleif in the fact that because their rockstar programmer  wrote nice crisp code with Rails, so he could do the same with react (inspite of  not having any real project exprience with it)

# Personal Challenges
- lack of understadning and communication with team
- baggage of a poorly communicated criticism of UI in early days with team
- non-alignment with vision and priorities of technical team
- achieving work life balance while working remotely
- nerd developer's image within the team
- lack of cooepration from the full time design consultant to the team
- non-involvement in decision making
