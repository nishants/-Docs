# Mindset Challenges
- gamification is different from usual business app, where development is usually driven by a list of features
- gamification should be experience driven, rather than feature driven.
- prototyping is the only good way of defining and discovering ur end user exprience.

# Using prototyping to discover end product
- we built the first fully functional prototype within a week of initiation
- we kept on building on top of the prototype for four weeks
- every week we demonstrated the prototype to all of team
- no user stories were ready when we began the prototyping for the first time
