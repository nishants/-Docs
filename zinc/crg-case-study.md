# Product Challenges
- gamification is different from usual business app, where development is usually driven by a list of features
- gamification should be experience driven, rather than feature driven.
- prototyping is the only good way of defining and discovering ur end user exprience.
- there were four months to deliver the feature 
- it was a bootstrapped startup with a team distributed across the globe.

# Using Prototyping to Discover End Product
- we built the first fully functional prototype within a week of initiation
- we kept on building on top of the prototype for four weeks
- every week we demonstrated the prototype to all of team
- no user stories were ready when we began the prototyping for the first time

# Project Management Challenges
- hard to define a gamification exprience in terms of a checklist
- designer, founder, marketing, technical experts were well aligned on idea but common understanding of end product was missing
- it was hard to define requirements in terms of backlog, hence creating good user stories was impossible.
- developers were not confident of task lists, spikes, estimations required to plan the realease.
- prototyping itself is again hard to estimate, we allowed a product designer to play around with our idea and be free and creative  with whatever he comes up with.
- prototyping occupied one dedicated resource over the period of 4 weeks.

# Consulting Challenges
- technical team lacked a culture of working with consultants 
- team morale was low, and on first interview with a developer, he confessed of being a "foot sodier" and felt he had no contribution in decision making
- technical team was thinking in terms of techs and framework, and there was a lack of problem solving approach.
- technical team lacked diversity, all devs were males with background of fullstack rails developer.
- technical team had recently decided to migrate to reactjs based techstack.
- instead advised them on not using react for a new and critical feature, but begin by re-writting what team had already built
- technical team ignored advice and moved ahead with building the feature with reactjs.
- this was mainly driven by developers anxiety (i dont know that cool new thing that earns jobs) and beleif in the fact that because their rockstar programmer  wrote nice crisp code with Rails, and promised he would do the same with react (inspite of  not having any real project exprience with it)
