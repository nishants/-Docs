EOS.IO Blockchain

- The protocol emulates most of the attributes of a real computer including hardware (CPU(s) & GPU(s) for processing, local/RAM memory, hard-disk storage) with the computing resources distributed equally among EOS cryptocurrency holders. 
- with the computing resources distributed equally among EOS cryptocurrency holders.
- operates as a smart contract platform and decentralized operating system
- intended for the deployment of industrial-scale decentralized applications through a decentralized autonomous corporation model
- The smart contract platform claims to eliminate transaction fees and also conduct millions of transactions per second.



Technical Characterstics

- decentralized application hosting, smart contract capability and decentralized storage of enterprise solutions 
- multi-threaded (able to run on multiple computer cores) 
- proof-of-stake for its consensus protocol
- WebsAssembly choosen for general puporse and smart contract language 



Stakehodler priviliges 

- EOS, is a utility token that provides both bandwidth and storage on the
blockchain, in proportion to total stake (owning 1% of EOS tokens 
allows for usage of up to 1% of the total available bandwidth)
- EOS tokens also allow the owner to cast votes and participate in the 
on-chain governance of the blockchain, again in proportion to the 
owner's stake.



Block Producers

- 21 block producers
- voted by token holders
- 
- will generate and validate blocks within a 500 ms block time. 



Account creation on EOSIIO Blockchain

- permits all accounts to be referenced by a unique human readable name of up to 12 characters in length
- name is chosen by the creator of the account
- The account creator must reserve the RAM required to store the new 
account until the new account stakes tokens to reserve its own RAM



WebAssembly (often shortened to Wasm) is an open standard that defines a portable binary code format for executable programs, and a corresponding textual assembly language, as well as interfaces for facilitating interactions between such programs and their host environment.[1][2][3][4] The main goal of WebAssembly is to enable high performance applications on web pages, but the format is designed to be executed and integrated in other environments as well.[5][6]

Decentralized Autonomous Organization  (DAO)

- sometimes labeled a decentralized autonomous corporation (DAC), is an organization represented by rules encoded as a computer program that is transparent and  controlled by shareholders
- A DAO's financial transaction record and program rules are maintained on a blockchain





Security Breaches and recovery

Secuirity of Decentralized Autonomous Organization

- A well-known example, intended for venture capital funding, was The DAO, which launched with 150 million in crowdfunding in June 2016, and was immediately hacked and drained of US50 million in cryptocurrency.[7] This hack was reversed in the following weeks, and the money restored, via a hard fork of the Ethereum blockchain. This bailout was made possible by the Ethereum miners and clients switching to the new fork
